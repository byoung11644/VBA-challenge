# VBA Example - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

In this Excel example assignment, I will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.


### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run scripts on this data to generate the final report.

### Stock market analyst

## Instructions

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### CHALLENGES

1. The solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
